```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```



```
Your code ran without any interuption in my computer.
You inspected the data well.
Placing files within folders made it easy to access them.
Good thinking with mapping position/1 million for visualization of snps distribution accross chromosomes. This made it look neat.
The x-axis in the graphs with groups have overlapping labels. Otherwise they look good.
Overall, the data inspection was thorough, processing and visualization of the data was well explained. Good work with the assignment!
