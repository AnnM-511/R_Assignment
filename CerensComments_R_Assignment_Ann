Hello Ann!
Your code ran in my computer just fine.
Your data inspection was great! I wasn't able to figure out how to do "-" instead of "?" but you figured that out pretty easily.
Maybe for the final version of your assignment, you could just do the dim command instead of nrow and ncol since you end up with the same information?
This is just a suggestion though.
Your files are super organized since you made individual files for them.
When it comes to your visualization, your graphs look really organized! 
On your last visualization exercise, the X-axis labels are overlapping with each other but maybe that's because my screen is too small? It doesn't look too bad.
I wish I knew how to fix that but other than that your assignment looks great!
Best!
Ceren
